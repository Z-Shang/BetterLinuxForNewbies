### * vim_files_by_phoenixizx

lilydjwg's vim configuration, original .vimrc is dotvim/vimrc.lilydjwg. A simpler(or less function for vim newbies) one is dotvim/vimrc.phoenixlzx, move the vimrc file you want to use to $HOME/.vimrc, and rename dotvim folder to .vim under your $HOME directory. Need ctags, cscope and vim-neocomplcache installed.
